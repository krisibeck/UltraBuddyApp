> Ultra Buddy provides information for runners during ultra races. 
> The runner can see a map of the race with aid stations along the way.
> By touching an aid station, the runner is shown the distance remaining to that station. 
> More detailed infrmation, such as elevation gain and lost is available also. 
> Three running races are currently integrated into the app: Vitosha100, Tryavna100, and Persenk110.
